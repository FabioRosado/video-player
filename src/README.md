Render the video found in the public folder on the page. Make it as pretty (or as ugly) as you like. In the public/images folder you will find three images that should render in the following ways during the video playing. Timings are in reference to the current time of the video. Using a native html5 video component is preferred.

Image 1:
- shows at 3500ms
- shows for 1000ms
- shows up once (i.e. when rewinding it should not show up again).
- shows in top left

Image 2:
- shows at 6000ms
- shows for 2000ms
- shows up twice
- shows in top right

Image 3:
- shows at 7000ms
- shows for 1500ms
- shows up three times
- shows up in centre

Feel free to ask any questions, as well as to have fun and expand on the specification as much as you like (e.g. custom controls, fullscreen toggle button, a button that runs away from your cursor). 

If you're struggling, take notes about areas you are having trouble with, proposed solutions you have considered etc.
